- ðŸŒ± I am a master's student in computer, expect to graduate in 2025. I focused on Domain Adaptive ReID during my graduate studies, while my undergraduate studies focused on back-end development and big data development. 

- ðŸ¤” I am particularly passionate about these areas, especially enjoying the challenges of designing backend systems and handling complex data processing tasks. I am currently looking for an official Offer for 2025, looking to develop further my skills and knowledge in back-end/server development, big data development, or artificial intelligence research and development.

- ðŸ”­ In addition, I am very interested in the on-the-ground application of AI models, including the design API or model deployment, and lightweight deployment and acceleration on mobile.
